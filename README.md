# Hand Gesture Predicting Model using CNN

![Task_04](images/task_04_tasks.png)

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **machine learning workflow**, including:

* Data preprocessing and cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Model training and evaluation using **Random Forest**
* Visualization of results

The goal is to build and evaluate a predictive model while gaining hands-on experience with common ML techniques.
